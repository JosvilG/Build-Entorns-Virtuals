## General info

The purpose of this project was to create a puzzle system that would allow you to get from start to finish by solving the puzzles.
In addition to having said system working, combat, enemies, different zones, sounds, music, a minimap and a spawn system were also added.

It was created with the collaboration of three students.

## ¡Important!

Due to the reduced time we had to carry out the project, we took as a base another file that we had created for the group of students, so there are files that do not correspond to this project.
